# IMDB Data Visualization

This was a project that I did in a group with 3 other people during a summer program. In this project, my main contribution is in writing the
algorithms to categorize the movie posters by color and predict the IMDB rating of a movie based on the colors in its movie poster.

DESCRIPTION
If a picture is worth a thousand words, a good movie poster might be worth a million (or more) ticket sales - a topic on every filmmaker’s mind as viewers consider whether to take a trip to the theater or to stay at home on the couch.  It’s a smart time to inform artistic decisions (or, for the more commercially-minded, hedge marketing moves) using data-driven insights.  This project will offer at least one meaningful solution in two parts, by assessing poster image colors and content using ML libraries and custom algorithms and by delivering cross-referenced results through an attractive and interactive interface.

Goal: Build a web application backed with server-side ML / custom-algo processing and client-side d3 / custom-js visualization. 

DATA
In this project you will be working with a list of metadata from 5000 movies on IMDB by Chuan Sun (Github user @sundeepblue) . Dataset: [here](https://github.com/sundeepblue/movie_rating_prediction)

Considerations:

You will need to follow steps to scrape images of IMDB posters and store ~1GB.

You may decide to write custom algorithms to evaluate color properties.

You may decide to use ML detection to evaluate other properties.

You will need to deliver data to the client-side for visualization operations.

You will need to develop custom modules for data presentation and exploration.
